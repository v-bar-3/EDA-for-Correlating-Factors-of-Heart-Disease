# EDA for Correlating Factors of Heart-Disease
This is the first project for STA 106: Analysis of Variance.

This project utilizes the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset

Project Guidelines and Prompt:

"Explore the variables in this dataset and their effect on BMI."

While a very loose prompt, this project utilizes basic data visualizations, contingency tables, and odd-ratios to find the most effective predictive variable on BMI.

Conclusion:

Although it is more difficult to compare the continuous variables to the categorical variables, we can make assess some of the leading factors for heart disease and heart attacks.

Amongst the categorical variables, the leading factors are past Stroke - 6.89x, High Blood Pressure - 5.0x, Difficulty Walking - 4.29x, Diabetes - 3.62x, and High Cholesterol - 3.6x.

Variables like Fruits, Veggies, Heavy Alcohol Consumption, Sex, and BMI are not as big of factors.

When looking at the outer extremes of categorical variables like Income and Education, the odds of heart disease are much less for people with higher ranking levels.
